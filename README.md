# Real-Time Chat Web Application

Developed a real-time chat web application using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Socket.IO, enabling instant messaging, user identification, and notifications for new messages and user join/leave events.

This is a simple real-time chat web application built using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Socket.IO. It allows users to join a chat room, send and receive messages in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time communication: Users can send and receive messages instantly without the need to refresh the page.
- User identification: Each user is identified by their name, which is displayed in the chat room.
- Message notifications: When a new message is received, an audio notification is played.
- User join/leave notifications: When a user joins or leaves the chat room, a notification is displayed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to structure the web page and define its elements.
- CSS: Used for styling the web page and creating an attractive user interface.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to run the server-side code.
- Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the web browser and the server.

## Getting Started
